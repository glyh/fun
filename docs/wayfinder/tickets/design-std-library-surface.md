# Design the user-facing library surface of std

## Question

After [the restructure](restructure-std-into-bootstrap-and-library.md) gives `std/`
a bootstrap layer and a library layer, the library holds a first cut of the List
and Option API. **What should the library's public surface actually be** — names,
signatures, argument order, what is in versus out, and how it is documented?

This is a grilling ticket: the answers are decisions, so it is worked by interview,
one branch at a time.

## Context

- **Blocked by** [Restructure std into a bootstrap layer and a library layer](restructure-std-into-bootstrap-and-library.md),
  which decides the seam and lands the first cut. Design against the real
  `std/bootstrap.fun` plus library units, not against a plan.
- **The seam is already fixed**: the bootstrap layer is exactly what C#
  names by string (`Syntax` + `Bool`/`Option`/`List`). Their *names* and
  constructors cannot move, so the design must work around them rather than
  through them.
- **Two neighbouring tickets own parts of this, deliberately not repeated here:**
  [Design trait library deriving and protocols](design-trait-library-deriving-and-protocols.md)
  owns deriving and protocol-style ops; [Specify stage 11 macro-powered language features](specify-stage-11-macro-powered-language-features.md)
  owns surface features that would arrive as macros.
- **The map's standing caution** is the fog item *"Library-level features vs
  compiler machinery"*: prefer library-level macros and type-case over new
  compiler machinery, and do not let library work drive the compiler agenda.
- **Docs on the shape of the language** the library must use:
  [`CONTEXT.md`](../../CONTEXT.md) for vocabulary, and
  [`docs/wayfinder/topics/trait-module-stdlib.md`](../topics/trait-module-stdlib.md).

## What the library does not have today (measured 2026-09-26)

`std/lib.fun` after the restructure will hold `if`, `i64_to_bool`, the
comparison/arithmetic operators and their fixity, `Eq` + five impls, and nothing
else. Missing:

- **List beyond the first cut**: no `length`, `head`/`tail`, `concat`,
  `filter`, `zip`, `any`/`all`, `nth`, `take`/`drop`, `range`.
- **Option**: only `Some`/`None`; no `map`, `bind`, `unwrap`/`get_or`, `is_some`.
- **String**: nothing but the primitives `eq_string`/`neq_string`
  (`Primitives.cs:59-60`) — no `length`, `concat`, `split`, `chars`.
- **Bool**: `not` only; no `and`/`or` as values (the operators are syntax forms).
- **I64**: operators only — no `min`/`max`, `abs`, `to_string`, and no
  float/`U64`/`U8` types at all (check `Primitives.cs` for the real floor).
- **Traits**: `Eq` only. No `Show`, `Ord`, `Semigroup`, `Monoid`.
- **No docs convention** on any `pub` binding, and no test tree of its own.

## Open branches (to be grilled, one at a time)

1. **List/Option API naming and shape.** There is no precedent to copy, so this
   first cut sets one: positional versus half-open indices, `fold`'s argument
   order and accumulator position, `map`'s function-first convention, whether
   functions are curried or take all arguments, and whether the names come from
   OCaml/ML (`rev`, `fold_left`) or from the surface the language already uses.
2. **`head`/`nth`/`tail` on the empty list**: `Option`, `panic`, or an effect.
   This is a genuine design fork, not a style question, and it decides the shape
   of everything downstream.
3. **Traits the library defines versus the compiler keeps.** `Eq` currently lives
   in `lib`. Should `Show`/`Ord`/`Semigroup` follow, and does a library trait need
   a library-level `impl` story (including how impls are named and opened)?
4. **Documentation**: does the surface get a doc convention, and is there a
   surface-syntax slot for it? (Check whether a doc-comment form exists before
   designing one.)
5. **Importability**: may a program write `import "std/list"` directly, or only
   reach the library through `std`? The restructure leaves `Prelude.Of` able to
   answer this either way, so it is a policy decision.
6. **What is deliberately out**, so the ticket ends: UFCS, FFI and protocol/
   deriving machinery are named as "not now" in the map's fog; confirm the rest.

## Answer — decided 2026-09-27 (grilled to an empty frontier)

Nineteen decisions: sixteen from the first two rounds, and §17–§19 closing the loose
ends the first round left inside option text and the one inconsistency it created. **This section
supersedes the "what the library does not have today" list above**, which was
measured on 2026-09-26 and is wrong in two places: `test/conformance/cases/std/`
now exists (7 pairs), and the String/I64 halves of that list are unwritable for a
reason the list did not know (§4).

### 1. Scope — batteries-included, bounded

`std`'s library layer is the standard library a program just uses, bounded by the
compiler staying small: no new compiler machinery, and UFCS / FFI /
deriving-protocol machinery stay in
[design-trait-library-deriving-and-protocols](design-trait-library-deriving-and-protocols.md)
and the Stage 11 spec.

### 2. Namespace — per-type modules plus bare globals

After `import "std"`, a type's API is reached by qualification (`Std.Lists.map`),
and a bare `map`/`length` exists **only after the user's own `open`**. The two are
mutually exclusive because a bare name would be resolved by open *order*: measured,
two modules both exporting `map` and both opened give the last one, silently —
`{ A = module { pub map = fn(x) { x + 1 } }; B = module { pub map = fn(x) { x + 2 } };
open A; open B; map(1) }` is `VALUE 3`. `open Std.Lists;` on its own is legal
(measured), so the qualified style costs the user nothing it cannot undo.

### 3. Reach — member selection is the surface; strings stay loader-level

Any unit resolves, `std/bootstrap` included (policy unchanged, the loader keeps
`import "std"` as a *spelling*, not a privilege). `import` is not generalized to
path expressions: that would give the unit tree and the value tree one spelling
(`import std.List` vs `std.List.map`) resolving in two different systems.

### 4. The primitive floor is the boundary — String and `Show` wait

`src/Fun.Compiler/Primitives.cs:44-73` is the whole floor: I64 arithmetic and six
comparisons, `eq/neq` for Char/Unit/String, `panic`, `expand_block`,
`expand_decls`, `Tuple`/`tuple_arity`. There is **no** `print` and `src/Fun.Cli` is a
stub, so a program communicates only by its return value. Therefore `I64.to_string`,
`String.length/concat/split`, `Char`↔`String`, `Show`, and `Ord` beyond I64 are all
out, and the out-list is honest rather than lazy: nothing could observe them yet.

### 5. Names — spelled-out ML-familiar verbs

`length`, `reverse` (renamed from `rev`), `append` (two lists), `concat` (list of
lists), `map`, `filter`, `fold` (left fold), `find`, `head`, `tail`, `nth`,
`get_or`, `is_some`. The four universal short verbs stay short; the renames follow
the house style (`i64_to_bool`, `pat_wild`, `RawPatWild`) rather than ML's (`rev`,
`hd`, `tl`).

### 6. Argument order — policy first, subject last, uniformly

`map(f, xs)`, `fold(f, z, xs)`, `nth(i, xs)`, `take(n, xs)`, `find(p, xs)`. Keeps
the six shipped bindings. Currying is free (`f(a, b)` is `Ap(Ap(f,a),b)`), so this is
the order that makes partial application useful: `take(2)`, `nth(0)`.

**Its one hole, closed by §7**: a default value goes *first*, not last.

### 7. Defaults — default first

`Options.get_or(d, o)`, `Lists.head_or(d, xs)`, `Lists.nth_or(d, i, xs)`. Haskell's
`fromMaybe d o` is the precedent, and it is the form that curries into the useful
thing: `get_or(0)` is `Option(I64) -> I64`.

### 8. Empty list — `Option`, with saturating `take`/`drop`

`head : List(A) -> Option(A)`, `tail : List(A) -> Option(List(A))`,
`nth : (I64, List(A)) -> Option(A)`, `find : (A -> Bool, List(A)) -> Option(A)`.
`take`/`drop` take counts and saturate. `Option` is already the ABI bootstrap's
(`mk_option`, `Some`/`None`), so it costs the interface nothing, and an aborting
`nth` next to an Option-returning `head` is the inconsistency this avoids.

### 9. Indices — 0-based; counts for `take`/`drop`; `range(n)` only

0-based matches the language's own `.0` projection and `Tuple(n, …)`. `take`/`drop`
take counts, so they need no clamping decision beyond saturating. `range(n)` is
`[0, n)`, `Nil` for `n <= 0`. `slice`/`range(lo, hi)` are out until something needs
them; **half-open is the recorded principle** if they land.

### 10. Module names — plural, because the singulars are frozen

`Lists`, `Options`, `Strings`. `List`/`Option`/`Bool`/`String` are the ABI's type
names and cannot be reused: measured, `List.map` fails with `ELAB no constructor
map` —
`List` resolves to the type former. `std/stage2.fun` already pilots this privately
(`Types`, `Lists`). This decides the *names*; which of them are declared is §16 and
§19 — the first cut ships `Lists` and `Options` only.

### 11. Bundle name — `Std`

`Prelude.Binding` becomes `Std`, so the unit, the path and the handle agree:
`Std.Lists.map(f, xs)`. Capitalized, matching `Syntax` — modules capitalized,
functions snake_case, types singular.

### 12. Unit layout — one unit per module; `std` re-exports only the impls

`std/list.fun` **is** the `Lists` module (functions plus
`pub impl list_eq : Eq(List(A))` at its top); a new `std/option.fun` is `Options`
(with `option_map`/`option_bind` moved out of list.fun and renamed `map`/`bind`);
`std/stage2.fun` publishes them (`pub Lists = import "std/list"`) and re-exports
only the impls — `export Lists.{list_eq}` — so nothing flattens and
`Std.Lists.map` is the only spelling of `map`.

This rests on four measurements, and the distinction between the first two is the
whole reason the design works:

| probe | result |
| --- | --- |
| `N = module { export M; … }; N.x` | `VALUE 1` — `export` **flattens** into N |
| `N = module { open M; … }; N.x` | `no public member `x`` — `open` only **scopes** |
| stage2 with `open Lists` deleted, `export Lists` kept | bare `rev`/`map` still work — **`open` does not propagate to importers, `export` does** |
| `export M.{Color, color_eq}` then `Color.R == Color.G`; and `other` | `VALUE True`; `unbound variable: other` — selective export **carries an impl** and drops everything else |

### 13. Impls — with their type, rule unchanged

`Eq` stays the library's only trait (it is not in `PreludeAbi.cs` — the compiler
does not name it), impls are named and public, and the five primitive-backed ones
stay at `stdlib`'s top level because `I64`/`Char`/`Unit`/`String`/`Bool` have no
module to live in. **Impl visibility is not flipped to option B.**
[impl-visibility](../topics/impl-visibility.md) already weighed A against B and
recommended A plus named impls, and B costs a kernel change: a nominal carries an
id, a name, parameters and constructors but **no back-pointer to its defining
module**. B also does not fix coherence (that follows from scoped resolution,
settled in [traits](../topics/traits.md)) and spends legibility the way Scala's
implicit scope does.

The gap B would have closed — an impl reaching a use site only through a wholesale
`open`, with no selective open and silent shadowing — is real and is now
[selective open](selective-open.md)'s ticket.

### 14. Library-defined syntax — none added here

`std/lib.fun` already declares `pub syntax if`, `pub infix (&&) conjunction` and
five order groups, and `std/type.fun` declares `pub syntax type`. That right is
untouched; the candidates that change how a user *writes* a program (a pipeline,
list literals, an `Option` postfix) are
[the Stage 11 spec](specify-stage-11-macro-powered-language-features.md)'s.

### 15. Documentation — pin the shape now

A fixed comment above every `pub` binding: one line with what it returns and what
it does on the empty / out-of-range case (the §8 decisions a signature cannot
show), plus one line per module naming what belongs in it. Ordinary `#` comments —
the reader has no doc construct, and **no `pub` binding in `std/` carries prose
today**. A real doc syntax is deferred with a trigger: **adopt C#'s form once the
language self-hosts on .NET.**

### 16. Contents — everything the floor allows, in one pass

| module | bindings |
| --- | --- |
| `Lists` | length, reverse, append, concat, map, filter, fold, find, head, tail, nth, head_or, nth_or, take, drop, zip, zip_with, any, all, range, `pub impl list_eq` |
| `Options` | map, bind, get_or, or_else, filter, is_some, `pub impl option_eq` |
| `Std` top level | and, or, min, max, abs (beside the existing not, `if`, operators, `Eq`, five impls) |

Generic impls are what make the two `Eq` impls expressible at all; they landed
2026-09-27 ([trait-op-takes-innermost-impl](trait-op-takes-innermost-impl.md),
`790 cases, 0 failed`), and `Tuple(2, I64, Bool)` is a legal signature type
(measured), so `zip` returning pairs is too.

**Deliberately out, so the ticket ends**: String beyond equality, `Show`, `Ord`,
`fold_right`, `slice` and `range(lo, hi)`, `Options.map2` (see §18), a `Strings`
module (see §19), every new
surface syntax, and every change to impl reach.

### 17. `zip` truncates to the shorter list

`zip(xs, ys) : List(Tuple(2, A, B))` stops at the shorter input; the count is
`min(length(xs), length(ys))` and there is no failure path. This was decided inside
§16's option text rather than asked, and is now on the record: total, and the
convention of the languages this family borrows from. The cost accepted is that a
length mismatch is silent — `zip([1, 2, 3], [a, b])` is `[(1, a), (2, b)]` with no
complaint. `zip_with(f, xs, ys)` follows the same rule.

### 18. The extras that ship, and the one that does not

Ship `Lists.zip_with(f, xs, ys)`, `Options.or_else(d, o)` (default-first, per §7)
and `Options.filter(p, o)`. Held back: **`Options.map2`** — in a language with no
applicative or `?`-style syntax yet it is a workaround for missing surface sugar,
which §14 sent to the Stage 11 spec; shipping it commits a name that Stage 11 may
make redundant and starts the `map2`/`map3`/`map4` road. Also not added: any
`expect`/`unwrap`-style panicking helper, which would reopen §8 — argue it as such
if it is wanted, rather than letting it in as a convenience.

### 19. `Strings` is named, not declared

`Std.Strings` does not exist in the first cut. §10 decided the plural *names*, so
that the frozen singulars are never re-used; it did not promise that every module is
declared on day one. Nothing a `Strings` module could hold is writable inside §4's
floor — `length`, `concat`, `split`, `chars` each need a primitive that does not
exist — while `==`/`!=` on strings already work through the bootstrap impl. An empty
public module is a name with nothing behind it and a standing invitation to add a
function just to justify it, so `Std.Strings` appears with its first real binding,
which is when the primitives land.

### Consequences and deliverables

- **Breaking, and intended**: today's bare `rev`/`map`/`fold`/`append`/
  `option_map`/`option_bind` stop existing, so the existing
  `test/conformance/cases/std/` pairs are rewritten to the qualified spelling, and
  `std/README.md` gains the surface and the module table.
- **New ticket opened by this one**: [selective open](selective-open.md) —
  `open M.{a, b}`, the mirror of the working `export M.{a, b}`.
- **Explicitly not to be reopened as-is**: `M.(e)`
  ([local-open-expression](local-open-expression.md), ruled B on 2026-09-18) is a
  second spelling of `{ open M; e }` and buys nothing selective-open does not. If
  the double-brace idiom becomes an irritant, the evidence that ticket asked for is
  call sites, which this ticket's implementation will produce.
- **Three things an implementing fork must verify rather than assume**: that
  `export Lists.{list_eq}` puts the impl in a *program's* base scope (measured only
  with local modules so far); that a program can write `open Std.Lists;`; and that
  nothing outside `std/` referenced the old bare names.

# A .NET backend

## Question

Add a compilation backend that targets .NET — lowering `Core.term` to something runnable on the
runtime the compiler itself already sits on (the implementation is C# on .NET 10) — so a `fun`
program can be built and run as a .NET artifact, not only interpreted through NbE.

## Where it stands

- **There is no backend.** The pipeline ends at NbE → value, and `src/Fun.Cli` is a stub that
  prints `fun: the .NET port has no entry point yet` and exits 1. The only way to run a program
  is the conformance runner's single-file mode.
- The only analysis is in `docs/ideas/compiler-architecture.md` §"Backend: C, LLVM, or your own —
  and what a second backend costs", whose verdict is **undecided and unscheduled**: *"there is no
  backend… Nothing in `docs/wayfinder` picks one — the closest is the fog item on the
  library-vs-compiler-machinery boundary (UFCS, FFI), which would have to be settled first."*
- This ticket is the first direction on the map that is **not** a language or macro question.

## The three options (from the ideas doc)

| option | what it means on a .NET host |
|---|---|
| (a) emit C from `Core.term` | a native dependency; the emitted code is the artifact |
| (b) a native dependency | call an existing backend (LLVM, libgccjit) instead of writing one |
| (c) a code generator over the host | write a generator **and** a collector — the ideas doc's option (c) |

## What it touches

- **A new pipeline stage after `Core.term`** — additive, not a restructure of the existing
  stages. The ideas doc: *"If a backend ever appears, this is the phase it will need."*
- **Effects/handlers.** .NET IL has no stack to save, so handlers would need evidence passing
  (route the request down as an argument) rather than stack capture —
  `docs/ideas/effects-and-handlers.md` records this as what makes handlers usable on .NET IL.
- **The FFI fog item** ("Library-level features vs compiler machinery") — a backend needs a story
  for calling out to .NET libraries, and the ideas doc says that boundary must be settled first.
- **Diagnostics.** Spans point at source today; a backend adds a second mapping
  (source → emitted code) to maintain.

## Why it is not scheduled

- **No consumer.** Every program in the tree runs through the interpreter; compile time is
  unmeasured, so the cost being optimized is unknown.
- **The second-backend cost is recorded:** Skew shipped four backends and still died of a small
  standard library.

## Open questions

1. **Which target** — (a) emit C, (b) a native dependency, or (c) a code generator plus
   collector over the host?
2. **Who owns the garbage collector** under option (c)?
3. **How do effects/handlers lower** — evidence passing (no stack on .NET IL) or a captured
   stack?
4. **Does a backend sharpen the content-addressed codebase fog item?** A persistent store pays
   off more when there is a build to cache — compile time is that item's sharpening condition.

## Sharpens when

Someone wants to run a `fun` program outside the interpreter — a binary, a library, or an FFI
consumer — and the interpreter is not enough.

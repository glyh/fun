## Macro infrastructure

### Disambiguate annotation names by scope (low, deferred)

Currently `known_type_names` in `enforest.ml` is a hardcoded list:
`["I64"; "Bool"; "Unit"; "Char"; "String"; "Type"; "Id"; "Span"; "Expr";
  "Option"; "List"; "AtomVal"; "Explicitness"; "Ref"; "Pattern"; "Decl"; "Trait"]`

When parsing `: Expr(Foo)`, if `Foo` is in `known_type_names`, it becomes a
constraint (`Expr(None, Some "Foo")`). Otherwise, if it starts uppercase, it
becomes a type-binding parameter (`Expr(Some "Foo", None)`).

This means a user who defines `type MyTag = I64` cannot use `: Expr(MyTag)`
as a constraint — `MyTag` is treated as a binder. The disambiguation should
be context-sensitive, tracking an environment of type names in scope rather
than a static list. This applies (at least) to all 3 sites where the implicit
R-type parameter is constructed in `enforest.ml` (~lines 308, 316, 336).

### Nominal identity vs. name comparisons

Any code that compares nominals by `String.equal` on names is fragile because
nominals can be aliased through rebinds (`type T = SomeNominal`). The nominal's
`id` field exists for identity comparison and should be used instead of name
comparison wherever possible.

## Elaborator / pattern matching

### Nested-module ADT constructor resolution (low)

`pub pattern PatWild = RawPatWild(_)` inside modules can fail because constructor
resolution traverses by type name, not constructor name. Affects pattern matching
in macro bodies for module-scoped ADTs. The `find_nominal_template_opt` and
related code in `elab_patterns.ml` and `elab_resolve.ml` need attention.

# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What is this

`fun` is a programming language compiler/interpreter written in OCaml 5.3. The implementation is centered on the `core_tt` dependent type pipeline: surface parser, bidirectional elaborator, normalization-by-evaluation runtime, nominal ADTs, structural records/modules, pattern matching, and file imports.

## Build commands

```sh
dune build                     # build
dune test                      # run all tests
dune exec bin/main.exe         # launch REPL
```

There is no dedicated lint target; use `dune build` and `dune test` as the standard validation loop.

Run a single test suite:

```sh
dune exec test/backend/test_core.exe
dune exec test/semantic/test_elaborate.exe
dune exec test/syntax/test_syntax.exe
```

Run a single test case with Alcotest's test filter syntax when needed:

```sh
dune exec test/backend/test_core.exe -- test eval -e 'factorial'
```

## Compilation pipeline

```
Source string
  → Raw_syntax reader / Enforest
  → Parse_expand expansion/lowering
  → Surface.t
  → Elaborate.on_expr
  → Core.term + Core.value type
  → NBE evaluation / Elaborate.Ctx.eval
  → Debug.pp_value_short
```

`bin/main.ml` wires the REPL directly through the staged libraries. It parses each input expression through `Parse_expand.parse_expr`, creates a `Core_loader` rooted at `Sys.getcwd ()`, elaborates through `Elaborate.on_expr ~loader`, evaluates with `Elaborate.Ctx.eval`, and prints `value: type`. Exceptions are caught per input so the REPL stays alive after parse, elaboration, or runtime errors.

## Source layout

The implementation is split by pipeline stage, with each source folder owning its own Dune library.

- `lib/syntax/` — `Surface` and raw reader syntax types for the surface AST and parser boundary.
- `lib/expand/` — `Enforest`, `Parse_expand`, hygiene/binding infrastructure, and lowering from macro-facing syntax back to `Surface.t`.
- `lib/core_kernel/` — `Atom`, `Core`, and `Debug` for primitive atoms, core terms, semantic values, metas, and pretty-printers.
- `lib/semantic/match/` — `Core_decision_tree` and `Core_match_compile` for pattern matrix compilation and exhaustiveness checking.
- `lib/semantic/typecheck/` — `Elaborate` and `Unify` for bidirectional elaboration and metavariable solving.
- `lib/backend/interp/` — `Nbe` for normalization-by-evaluation and runtime match evaluation.
- `lib/loader/` — `Core_loader` for `.fun` import resolution, caching, and circular import detection.
- `test/backend/`, `test/semantic/`, and `test/syntax/` — tests grouped by pipeline stage.

## Important entrypoints

- `bin/main.ml` — executable REPL wiring for parse/elaborate/eval/print.
- `lib/expand/enforest.ml` — reader/enforester for expressions and `.fun` module files.
- `lib/syntax/surface.ml` — surface AST consumed by elaboration.
- `lib/expand/parse_expand.ml` — current parser entrypoint for downstream consumers; runs enforestation, built-in expansion, and lowering to `Surface.t`.
- `lib/semantic/typecheck/elaborate.ml` — bidirectional elaborator, context management, implicit insertion, pattern elaboration, and match exhaustiveness checks.
- `lib/backend/interp/nbe.ml` — normalization-by-evaluation, primitive evaluation, quoting, conversion, and runtime match evaluation.
- `lib/semantic/typecheck/unify.ml` — higher-order metavariable unification.
- `lib/semantic/match/core_match_compile.ml` and `lib/semantic/match/core_decision_tree.ml` — decision-tree match compilation.
- `lib/loader/core_loader.ml` — `.fun` import resolution, caching, and circular import detection.
- `lib/core_kernel/debug.ml` — compact pretty-printers for REPL/test output.

## Type system architecture

`core_tt` uses de Bruijn indices in core terms and de Bruijn levels in semantic values. Names exist at the surface/elaboration boundary for lookup and diagnostics, but the core representation is index-based.

The current universe model is `Type : Type`. This is intentionally simple and can be replaced with a universe hierarchy later.

Elaboration is bidirectional:

- `infer` synthesizes a core term and semantic type.
- `check` verifies a surface expression against an expected semantic type.
- implicit arguments are represented with explicitness flags on Pi/application forms and inserted with metavariables during elaboration.
- let-bound unsolved metas are generalized into implicit parameters, giving HM-like let-polymorphism through the dependent core.

Metavariable solving uses Miller-style pattern unification in `unify.ml`. `MetaContext` tracks solved and unsolved metas, and NbE `force` follows solved metas during normalization/conversion.

## Structs, records, modules, and ADTs

`struct ... end` is the universal structural value for records, modules, and namespaces. A struct can contain:

- field declarations: `x: I64;`
- computed public fields: `pub x = expr`
- private bindings: `x = expr`
- nested public/private type bindings
- `open` / `export` members for scoped imports and re-exports
- methods with `self` and `Self` support for record-like structs

Record construction uses a struct type value:

```fun
do
  Point = struct x: I64; y: I64; end
  Point{x = 1; y = 2}
end
```

Record patterns destructure by field name:

```fun
match p do
| Point {x; y} -> x + y
end
```

ADTs are nominal and are introduced with `type`:

```fun
do
  type Option(A) = Some(A) | None
  match Some(1) do
| Some(x) -> x
| None -> 0
end
end
```

Nominal type equality is by generated nominal id plus parameter equality, not by name.

## Pattern matching

Pattern matching is elaborated into core patterns and compiled through `Core_match_compile` into decision trees. Supported patterns include:

- wildcards and binders
- literal atoms (`I64`, `Bool`, `Char`, `Unit`)
- tuples/products
- nominal constructors, including qualified paths
- records, including renamed and partial field patterns
- or-patterns
- type-head patterns used by type-specialized primitives

The match compiler performs exhaustiveness checks for finite domains where possible and treats open domains, such as `Type`, conservatively.

## Imports

`import "path"` resolves to `<cwd>/path.fun`, using the process working directory as the import base. `Core_loader` parses imported files through the module parser entrypoint, caches parsed modules, and reports circular imports.

A `.fun` module file is parsed as a struct-like module body. Public members are exposed to import users through ordinary struct/module field access and `open`.

Tests depend on the staged libraries they exercise and `alcotest`.

## Language syntax notes

- Built-in types: `I64`, `Bool`, `Unit`, `Char`, `Type`.
- Type parameters are ordinary binders in dependent function types; implicit arguments use brackets.
- Explicit function type: `(x : A) -> B`; implicit function type: `[x : A] -> B`.
- Explicit application: `f(x)`; explicit implicit application: `f[A]`.
- ADTs: `do type Option(A) = Some(A) | None; ... end`.
- Records: `do Point = struct x: I64; y: I64; end; Point{x = 1; y = 2} end`.
- Field access: `expr.field`.
- Record patterns: `Point {x; y}`, `Point {x = n; _}`, and qualified forms such as `M.Point {x}`.
- Structs: `struct ... end` with value bindings, `pub` value bindings, `type`, `pub type`, `open`, and `export` members.
- Methods use `pub method name(...) -> expr` or `pub method name(...) do ... end`.
- `self` names the receiver inside methods; `Self` names the enclosing record type after field declarations.
- `open M` brings public members into scope for subsequent expressions in the enclosing block.
- Match: `match expr do | pat -> body | pat -> body end`.
- Effects: `effect State(S) = sig get : Unit -> S; put : S -> Unit end`.
- Recursive values use `let rec`.
- Comments: `(* ... *)` with nesting.
